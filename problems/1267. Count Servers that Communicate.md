# 1267. Count Servers that Communicate
Question Level: **Medium**  

[leetcode probem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-servers-that-communicate/)
## 題目大意
You are given a map of a server center, represented as a `m * n` integer matrix `grid`,  
where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means that it is no server.  
Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.  

Example 1:  
```
Input: grid = [[1,0],
               [0,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: No servers can communicate with others.
```

Example 2:  
```
Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0],
               [0,0,1,0],
               [0,0,1,0],
               [0,0,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The two servers in the first row can communicate with each other. 
             The two servers in the third column can communicate with each other. 
             The server at right bottom corner can't communicate with any other server.
```
Constraints:  

- `m == grid.length`  
- `n == grid[i].length`  
- `1 <= m <= 250`
- `1 <= n <= 250`
- `grid[i][j] == 0 or 1`

## 解題思路
### Method1. Counting:
#### 操作:
先計算每行或列有多少伺服器，之後遍歷判斷每行或列的伺服器數量是反否有超過1，  
意即當前的伺服器與其他伺服器相連。
```c
int countServers(int** grid, int gridSize, int* gridColSize){
    int sum = 0, m = gridSize, n = gridColSize[0];
    int rows[m], cols[n];
    memset(rows, 0, sizeof(int) * m);
    memset(cols, 0, sizeof(int) * n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
            if (grid[i][j]){
                rows[i]++;
                cols[j]++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
            if (grid[i][j] && (2 <= rows[i] || 2 <= cols[j])){
                sum++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return sum;
}
```

Time complexity: **O(N * M)**   
Space complexity: **O(N + M)**
